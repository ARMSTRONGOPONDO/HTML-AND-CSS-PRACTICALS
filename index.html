<p><B>Improving our patients� experience � invitation to our �In our shoes� sessions</B>

<P>At Kingston Hospital NHS Trust our ambition is for all of our patients to experience care that is safe, compassionate and of the highest quality. As a part of this we are building on work we have done so far to improve our patients� experience, by listening to the actual experiences and views of our patients. 
We would like to hear your views about what was good about the care you or your loved one received and what you feel needs improving.
To do this, we are running a series of <I>�In Your Shoes�</I> events in November 2011. Each workshop will last around 2 hours. Patients who attend will be able to:
<OL type="i"> 
<LI>share your recent experiences in our care, one-to-one with a member of the hospital team, letting them know what it was like �in your shoes�

<LI>discuss what went well, as well as what needs improving
<LI>share your ideas and listen to other people�s views in group discussions
<LI>help us shape our vision for the standards of care all our staff will live up to
</OL>
